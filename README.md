5th year Applied Software Engineering group project. The Project involved the collection and consistency checking of a sequence of Datasets containing telecommunications network “events”, and the organization and storage of these data in a form which supports simple and complex queries, data analysis, and graphing.

The Project was undertaken using an Agile Development approach:
* Working in teams, appointing a Scrum Master, all members contributing to the technical activities (Design, Code and Test)
* Elaborating requirements, breaking down User Stories, adding detail
* Breaking work into Sprints of fixed duration (3 weeks per Sprint)
* Goal, Backlog, Definition of Done
* Defining and tracking team Velocity using Story Points and Burndown charts - Jira
* Conducting daily Stand Up meetings to review progress
* What did you do yesterday, what will you do today, and are there any impediments in your way?
* Demonstrating working software at the end of each Sprint
* Conducting Sprint retrospectives
* What went well, what went bad, and how can we improve?
